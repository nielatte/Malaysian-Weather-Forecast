# Malaysian-Weather-Forecast
I've created a simple Weather Forecast App using web languange such as html, css and js

I had trouble with CORS so i cant use the json file for the lists of cities so i need to put it in my scripts file, Im sorry for the 500+ lines of js.

The weather forecast i used open meteo API, it used a latitude and longtitude to locate the place so i need to determine the lat and lon to pin the cities.

Other than that, the rest of the scripts its a simple backend and a interactive frontend i added a calm music so you guys can have some fun listening to it, Sorry if your cities is not included :(

Btw all the cities are in Malaysia if you like to add some feel free to use the source code, There is 327 cities so far. ***Particle-js is not working if you guys can fix it i appreciate it***

I still can give you the JSON file u figure out the what to change in js, thats all then. thank you for stopping by
