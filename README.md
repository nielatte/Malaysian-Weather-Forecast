# Malaysian-Weather-Forecast
I've created a simple Weather Forecast App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now, I hit a bit of a snag with CORS (that pesky friend who just won’t let you in), so instead of using a JSON file for my list of cities, I had to cram all 500+ lines of code into my scripts file. Yes, it's a JavaScript jungle in there! 🐒

This app leans on the Open Meteo API, which plays the latitude and longitude game to find cities. I’ve tracked down the coordinates for 327 Malaysian cities—if your city isn’t in there, don’t worry, it’s not personal; it’s just a city thing! 😅

I've added some calm music for a relaxing experience. 

Oh, and by the way, Particle.js is throwing a tantrum and refuses to work. If anyone can give it a pep talk, I’d be forever grateful!

Feel free to use the source code, and if you want to add your favorite cities, go wild! I can share the JSON file too, so you can tweak the JavaScript as needed. Thanks for stopping by, and may your weather be ever in your favor!
